About Me 
==========

Hello!! I'm Pavan Laxmipathy, a computational materials scientist and I have more than 6 years of experience in materials modeling. 

My research career is focused on the investigation of phase-field and sharp-interface models to address the role of diffusive-convective regime on solidification microstructures, such as grain boundary grooves, dendritic, tip splitting and poly-phase microstructures in binary alloys. Overall, the development of simulation code and post-processing tools to model and analyze microstructure evolution has been my primary area of research during my doctoral and post-doctoral studies.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/) Magdeburg, and working on the development of a computational workflow framework in numerical mathematics.
