About Me 
==========

Hello!! I'm Pavan Laxmipathy, a computational materials scientist and I have more than 6 years of experience in materials modeling. 

My research career is focused on the investigation of phase-field models to address the role of diffusive-convective regime in solidification microstructures, such as grain boundary grooves, dendritic, tip splitting and poly-phase microstructures in binary alloys. Overall, the development of simulation code and post-processing tools to model and analyze microstructure evolution has been my primary area of research during my doctoral and post-doctoral studies. I completed my PhD in early 2021 at [Institute of Applied Materials - Computational Materials Science, Institute of Technology](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/) , under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Britta Nestler](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/Mitarbeiter_nestler.php), and later continued as a postdoc until March 2022. 

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/) Magdeburg, and working on computational workflows in numerical mathematics.
