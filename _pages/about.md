About Me 
==========

Hello! I'm Pavan Laxmipathy, a computational materials scientist with several years of experience in the field of materials modeling.

My research career is centered around the investigation of phase-field models aimed at addressing the role of diffusive-convective regime on 
solidification microstructures, such as grain boundary grooves, dendritic, tip splitting and poly-phase microstructures in binary alloys. 
I completed my PhD in early 2021 at the [Institute of Applied Materials - Computational Materials Science, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/),
 under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Britta Nestler](https://www.iam.kit.edu/mms/Mitarbeiter_nestler.php), 
 and later continued as a postdoctoral researcher until March 2022. Throughout my academic career, I have expanded 
 my expertise to include the emerging fields of alloy solidification,  electrochemistry, thin-film coatings, multiphase flows, and additive manufacturing.

Since May 2022, I hold the position of a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/), Magdeburg, 
and I am a member of [Prof. Dr. Peter Benner's](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/26532/16319) group, focused on 
[Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc). My work is dedicated to the 
advancement of computational workflows, seamlessly integrating the domains of numerical mathematics and materials science.
