About Me
==========

As a computational materials scientist I have more than 6 years of experience in academic research, and have extensively worked at various length scales in the domain of materials modelling. My research career is focused on the investigation of phase-field and sharp-interface models to address the role of diffusive-convective regime on solidification microstructures, such as dendritic, tip splitting and poly-phase microstructures in binary alloys. Overall, the development of simulation code and post-processing tools to model and analyze microstructure evolution has been my primary area of research during my doctoral and post-doctoral studies.

Currently, I'm working at Max Planck Institute Magdeburg as a scientific employee, and developer of a computational workflow framework in numerical mathematics.
