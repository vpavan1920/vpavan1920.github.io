### Location : [Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t, Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/)

* This Winter Semester, I'm a Teaching Assistant for the **Scientific Computing-I (WiSe 24/25)** course,
focused on the practical implementation of standard numerical algorithms. The course is designed to guide students through coding 
and algorithm development, with a focus on shell scripting, memory architecture, and management. 
Key topics covered will include basic operations, formats, matrix norms, and solving linear systems, 
offering hands-on experience in tackling these fundamental challenges.
